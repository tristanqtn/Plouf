## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository:

```

Build Docker images (this may take a few minutes, but it ensures that all dependencies are installed correctly):

```

dcu
Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and the API at http://localhost:8000 (disabled by default in docker compose, you can enable to port binding to directly access the API). I strongly recommend you to run this application on a static IP device in your network to avoid IP changes and to be able to access the application from any device in your network.

> **IMPORTANT:** Firewall configuration may be required to allow access to the application from other devices in your network.
